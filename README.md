# Economic-Growth-Determinants
Using a novel panel data set, this paper analyses the determinants of economic growth using a fixed effects multiple linear regression model with instrumental variables. Ultimately, contrary to traditional macroeconomic theory, almost no neoclassical growth factors prove to be statistically significant drivers of economic growth (bar phstical capital in LEDCs) but perhaps they help promote growth due to their complementary nature and via other channels like the improvement of export sophistication.

Note the R code attached is currently out-of-date and has since been updated for the final paper. This will be amended soon.
